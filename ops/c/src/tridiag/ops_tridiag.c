/* Assuming tridMultiDimBatchSolve() can do all 3 dimensions of the solve

1. copy over ops_dat->data to memaligned, x-dim padded blocks of memory
   - should we strip block halos ?
   (under MPI strip intra-block, i.e. MPI halos)
2. Perform tridiagonal solve in given dimension
3. copy back solution to ops_dat->data (i.e. strip the x-dim padding)

The problem is that we do not want to be copying over and over, especially as this
will be called within a iterative loop

If we increase the d_p[0] (the xdimension possitive block halo) so that size[0]
becomes a multiple of 32 (giving us padded memory) then atleast for single node
parallelizations we can simply use the ops_dat->data allocated by ops without copys
(is this true ?)

For MPI the above can be done, but will lead to large MPI halos in x-dimension
Is this somthing we can work with ?
